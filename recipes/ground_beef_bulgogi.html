        <p>This ground beef bulgogi dish only takes 15 minutes to cook,
            is super budget friendly, and a perfect fallback for when you
            you just don't feel like it! This recipe only calls for a 
            measly 11 ingredients total, but is so savory and delicious 
            it'll fit right into your regular rotation!

        <p>Whether you're hankerin' for a hearty korean dish or just need 
            to eat but don't feel like using your brain, you've found the 
            perfect recipe. The Bold bulgogi flavors paired with the juicy 
            beef make for a fantastic little trip for your taste buds! I 
            highly recommend serving this dish over fluffy <a href="recipes/perfect_rice.html">
            white rice</a> or with a side of steamed veggies to make a 
            complete meal!
