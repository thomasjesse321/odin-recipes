            <h3>For Bulgogi Sauce</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
            <li>4 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>

            <li>2 tbsp sweet rice wine (mirim)</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all bulgogi sauce ingredients in a small bowl and 
                set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add onion 
                and garlic, and cook until soft, about 1-2 minutes. Add 
                ground beef and cook until beef is browned and fully cooked.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the sauce mixture over the beef and stir to combine. 
                Allow the mixture to simmer until it is heated through and the 
                sauce reduces, about 2 minutes. Garnish with green onion and 
                sesame seeds, if desired. Serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
        <p>For a simple yet satisfying meal, sprinkle a modest amount of this 
            meaty topping over a bowl of steaming rice or hearty multigrain rice.
        </p>
        <p>Pair with your choice of fresh vegetables or a side of kimchi. You can 
            also compliment this dish with an assortment of traditional Korean side 
            dishes for a complete, flavor-packed meal.
        </p>
        <h2>Storage and reheating tip</h2>
        <p2>Store leftover beef in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also 
            freeze it in a freezer-safe zip bag for up to 3 months. To reheat, 
            either microwave to heat through or cook in a skillet with a little bit 
            of oil over the stove top.
