        <p>This delicious red curry soup is a hearty and healthy meal 
            that's both simple and easy to prepeare while keeping cook
            time minimal! It's also great for warming up on a cold

                fantastically flavorful concoction that will have you tossing 
                and turning while you dream of more!</p>

                    add additional water or broth to reach the desired
