        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This delicious red curry soup is a hearty and healthy meal 
            that's both simple and easy to prepeare while keeping cook
            time minimal! It's also great for warming up on a cold 
            winters day or feeling better when you're under the weather.</p>
            <p>Guy Fieri would be proud of this wondeful trip to Flavor Town.
                All the spices from the curry paste, that creamy texture
                from the coconut milk, along with the bright color and 
                delicious yet subtle notes of pumpkin coalesce into this 
                fantastically flavorful concoction that will have you tossing 
                and turning while you dream of more!</p>
