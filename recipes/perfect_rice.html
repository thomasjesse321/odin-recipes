        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you often find yourself struggling to get that restaurant
            quality rice in your kitchen at home then you're in the right
            place. This recipe will get you that perfect, soft, fluffy rice 
            we all love. Say hello to your new rice standard!
        </p>
        <p>This is a simple 4 step recipe that takes little to no time. Most
            of the work is done by the pot and the stove, so you can easily
            set it and forget it if you're also in the process of cooking 
            something else to go along with the rice. This recipe makes two 
            serving of rice. To make a bigger batch of this recipe, simply 
            add 2 cups of water for every one cup of rice. I love how easy and 
            painless this recipe is and I think you will too.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup white rice</li>
            <li>pot</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil Water: Get started by boiling 2 cups of water in an 
                uncovered pot. When the water has reached a boil, add 1/4 
                teaspoon of salt and 1 cup of white rice.
            <P>Pro Tip: To up the flavor, swap the 2 cups of water for 2 
                cups of broth (vegetable, chicken, or beef!)
            </P></li>
            <li>Let Simmer: Cover the pot and let it simmer for 18-20
                    minutes. As tempting as it may be, try not to stir or 
                    lift the lid while the rice is cooking.
                    <p>Pro Tip: When reheating, prevent cooked rice from 
                        drying out by breaking it up and adding a splash 
                        (or two) of water. Microwave on high heat until the 
                        rice is cooked through, about 1-1/2 minutes.
            </p></li>
            <li>Let Sit: Once the rice looks as fluffy as can be, take it 
                off the burner and let it sit for 5 minutes. This cooling 
                process allows the rice to steam and become the soft - but 
                not <em>too</em> soft - consistency that we all strive for. 
                <p>Pro Tip: Don't ditch the leftovers. Store cooked rice in 
                    airtight containers for up to 6 days after cooking.</p></li>
            <li>Fluff and Finish: Add more texture to the rice by fluffing 
                it with a fork. Before serving, top it off with 1/2 cup of 
                chopped herbs (like cilantro or parsley!).</li>
        </ol>
