        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you often find yourself struggling to get that restaurant
            quality rice in your kitchen at home then you're in the right
            place. This recipe will get you that perfect, soft, fluffy rice 
            we all love. Say hello to your new rice standard!
        </p>
        <p>This is a simple 4 step recipe that takes little to no time. Most
            of the work is done by the pot and the stove, so you can easily
            set it and forget it if you're also in the process of cooking 
            something else to go along with the rice. I love how easy and 
            painless this recipe is and I think you will too.
